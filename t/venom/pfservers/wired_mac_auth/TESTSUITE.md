# wired_mac_auth

Register a node with RADIUS in order to test MAC Authentication on Wired

## Requirements

### Global config steps
1. Create a role headless_device
1. Create switches and switch groups with role mapping

## Scenario steps
1. Enable node_cleanup task with following parameters:
- delete_windows=1m
1. Restart `pfcron` to take change into account
1. Create a node with MAC address of node01 (eth1) : 00:03:00:11:11:01
- assign the role headless_device without unreg date
- add a note
1. Create connection profile with specific filter Ethernet-NoEAP
1. Configure MAC authentication and dynamic VLAN on dot1x interface on
   switch01: will trigger a RADIUS request
1. Wait some time to let RADIUS request be sent by switch01 and handled by
   PacketFence server (`mab_activation_delay` + 20 seconds). switch01 also needs to handle answer.
1. Check RADIUS audit log for node01
1. Check VLAN assigned to node01 *on* switch01
1. Check Internet access *on* node01

## Teardown steps
1. Unregister node01:
   1. Generate a disconnect message
   1. Generate a RADIUS Accounting stop message (sent by switch01) which update
      `last_seen` attribute of node01
   1. Generate a new RADIUS request (sent by switch01) which update
      `last_seen` attribute of node01
   1. Generate a RADIUS Accounting start message (sent by switch01) which update
      `last_seen` attribute of node01
1. Wait some time before unconfigure switch01 to avoid a Disconnect-NAK
1. Unconfigure switch port and dynamic VLAN on switch01
   1. Generate a RADIUS Accounting stop message (sent by switch01) which update
      `last_seen` attribute of node01
1. Wait `delete_windows` + 10 seconds before running `node_cleanup` task
1. Delete node by running `pfcron's node_cleanup` task
1. Check node has been deleted
1. Disable `node_cleanup` task
1. Restart `pfcron` to take change into account
1. Delete connection profile
