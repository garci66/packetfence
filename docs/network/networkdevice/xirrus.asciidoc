//=== Xirrus

==== Xirrus WiFi Arrays

Xirrus Access Points can be configured to work with PacketFence quickly since Xirrus supports RADIUS assigned VLANs out of the box.

First, RADIUS server configuration. Set the RADIUS server to be PacketFence's IP: 

  radius-server  ! (global settings)
    !
    external
      primary     server 192.168.1.5
      primary     secret useStrongerSecret
      !
      accounting
        primary   server 192.168.1.5
        primary   secret useStrongerSecret
      exit
    exit
  exit

Enable SNMP Agent on the access point:

  snmp
    !
    v2
      community read-write public
      community read-only public
    exit
    !
  exit

Finally, don't forget to create the SSID you want and the proper bindings with the LAN. Open SSID should be configured to perform MAC Authentication and Secure SSID should be configured to perform 802.1X (WPA-Enterprise or WPA2-Enterprise).

===== External portal SSID

* Set *Encryption / Authentication* to None / Open
* Then check the WPR checkbox
* Then in in the section Web Page Redirect Configuration set *Server* to External Login
* Set the *Redirect URL* to http://192.168.1.5/Xirrus
* Set the *Redirect Secret* to any passphrase of your choice
* In the *RADIUS Configuration* section set the RADIUS server to point to your PacketFence server
