//=== Ruckus SmartZone

==== Webauth

==== SmartZone configuration

First, you will need to define your RADIUS server in _Configuration -> Service and Profiles -> Authentication_.

Create your server using the following information (where 192.168.1.5 is the IP address of your PacketFence management interface):

* 'IP Address:' 192.168.1.5
* 'Port': 1812
* 'Secret': useStrongerSecret

Then, in _Configuration -> Service and Profiles -> Accounting_, create a server with the following information:

* 'IP Address:' 192.168.1.5
* 'Port': 1813
* 'Secret': useStrongerSecret

After, create a Hotspot in _Configuration -> AP Zones -> Your Zone -> Hotspot WISPr -> Create New_. Adjust 192.168.1.5 to the IP address of your portal.

Then, still on this page, in the 'Walled Gardens', make sure you add the portal IP address in this list.

Next, you will need to configure your WLAN to use the Hotspot authentication and point it to PacketFence. Also ensure you set 'Use the controller as a proxy'.

Now, you should configure the Northbound API of the SmartZone so PacketFence can communicate with it. In order to do so, go in _Configuration -> System -> Northbound Portal Interface_ and set the 'Password' and save it. Keep the password closeby as it will be required for the PacketFence configuration. In this example, it will be `passwordForNorthboundAPI`.

In order to receive the information not encrypted in the URL, you will need to connect on the Ruckus SmartZone controller using SSH and do the following command:

 no encrypt-mac-ip


==== PacketFence configuration

In PacketFence, add a new switch in _Configuration -> Switches_ with the following configuration:

* *Definition -> External Portal Enforcement* should be enabled
* *Definition -> Type*: `Ruckus SmartZone Wireless Controller`
* *Definition -> Mode*: `production`
* *Roles -> Role by VLAN ID* should be enabled
* *Roles -> registration VLAN*: `-1`
* *Roles -> Role by Switch Role* should be disabled
* *RADIUS -> Secret passphrase*: `useStrongerSecret`
* *Web Services -> Password*: `passwordForNorthboundAPI`
