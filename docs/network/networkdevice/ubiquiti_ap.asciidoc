//=== Ubiquiti

==== Web Authentication

===== Unifi side

In order to configure web authentication (external captive-portal) on Ubiquiti access points, you must have access to a Unifi controller and your APs must be connected to it.

First, you must configure the guest policy. Go in _Settings -> hotspot -> general_ and configure it as shown below:

image::ubiquiti-unifi-guest-policy.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Unifi web-auth policy"]

Next, you must allow the device to reach the portal. Go in _Settings -> hotspot -> advanced_ and configure it as shown below:

image::ubiquiti-unifi-guest-policy_access.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Unifi web-auth policy"]

Make sure you enabled _Enable Guest Portal_, and that you've set _External portal server_.

You also need to enter the IP address of a portal enabled interface on the PacketFence server in _Custom Portal_. Then in the _ACCESS CONTROL_ section, add that same IP address to the _Pre-Authorization Access_

Then, still in the settings, create or edit a new SSID with the following settings:

image::ubiquiti-unifi-guest-ssid.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Unifi web-auth SSID"]

You need to ensure link:https://help.ubnt.com/hc/en-us/articles/115015457668-UniFi-Troubleshooting-STUN-Communication-Errors#whatisstun[STUN protocol] is allowed between access points and
controller so that controller gets link:https://help.ubnt.com/hc/en-us/articles/204976094#1[instant notifications] from access points. That's important to have a correct deauthentication mechanism.

===== PacketFence side

You have two choices to define the APs in PacketFence, by ip address (or range) or by MAC addresses.

By IP address:

If you decide to define the AP by ip then you will need to define the controller as a switch and define the Controller IP and Webservices information (Transport/Username/Password) in his configuration.

Then once done, restart pfcron service and run that to fill the PacketFence cache:

 /usr/local/pf/bin/pfcmd pfcron ubiquiti_ap_mac_to_ip

And verify that you have an entry for each AP

 /usr/local/pf/bin/pfcmd cache switch_distributed list


By MAC address:

Once this is done, you will need to define all your APs MAC addresses in the PacketFence switches with a configuration similar to this:

  [00:11:22:33:44:55]
  description=Ubiquiti AP
  ExternalPortalEnforcement=Y
  type=Ubiquiti::Unifi
  controllerIp=1.2.3.4
  wsTransport=HTTPS
  wsUser=admin
  wsPwd=admin

Where :

[options="compact"]
* *wsTransport* is the protocol used to connect to port 8443 of the Unifi controller and should be HTTPS. This is configured in the 'Web Services' tab of the switch.
* *wsUser* is a valid administrator username on your Unifi controller. This is configured in the 'Web Services' tab of the switch.
* *wsPwd* is the password that is associated to the wsUser. This is configured in the 'Web Services' tab of the switch.
* *controllerIp* is the IP address of your Unifi controller. This is configured in the 'Definition' tab of the switch.

==== VLAN Enforcement


In order to configure VLAN enforcement on the Unifi controller, you need first to configure a RADIUS profile, then a secure wireless network.

Important : You cannot reuse a VLAN ID for dynamic VLAN if it is set as a static value for another SSID on the same AP. So, if you have a SSID set to use VLAN 10, you cannot use VLAN ID 10 for RADIUS controlled VLAN users as those users will not get an IP address.

===== AAA Configuration

===== Open SSID

Create a open profile:

image::unifi-open.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Unifi Open Profile"]

image::unifi-open2.png[[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Unifi Open Profile"]


===== Secure SSID


Create a secured profile:

image::unifi-secure.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Unifi Secure SSID"]

image::unifi-secure2.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Unifi Secure SSID"]

===== CoA Support

CoA support has been introduced in the new version of the controller (Tested on 5.13.10), so on access reevaluation if you selected RADIUS as disconnect method then PacketFence will try a CoA.
