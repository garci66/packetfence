===== 802.1X

To setup the Cambium cnPilot E410 AP to use 802.1x, first, you need to already have configured the VLANs that will be used in the AP under _Configure -> Network_. Make sure that in _Configure -> Network -> Ethernet Ports_, the port is configured to *Trunk Multiple VLANs*, and the list of VLANs are allowed.

Next, go to _Configure -> WLAN_, and click on `Add New WLAN`. Give it the desired ID, and enter your SSID, default VLAN, and select *WPA2 Enterprise* for Security.
