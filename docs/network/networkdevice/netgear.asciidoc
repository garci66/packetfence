//=== Netgear

The "web-managed smart switch" models GS108Tv2/GS110/GS110TP are supported with Link up/down traps only.

Higher-end "fully managed" switches including FSM726v1 are supported in Port Security mode.

==== FSM726 / FSM726S version 1

PacketFence supports FSM726 / FSM726S version 1 switches _without VoIP_ in Port Security mode (with static MACs) â€“ called Trusted MAC table on Netgear's hardware.

Using the HTTP GUI, follow the steps below to configure such feature. Of course, you must create all your VLANs on the switch as well.

[float]
===== SNMP Settings

In _Advanced -> SNMP -> Community Table_, create a read-write community string and a trap community string. You can use the same community for all the 3 functions (Get, Set, Trap).
  
Next, under _Advanced -> SNMP -> Host Table_, enable the Host Authorization feature and add the PacketFence server into the allowed host list.

Finally, under _Advanced -> SNMP -> Trap Setting_, enable the authentication trap.

[float]
===== Trusted MAC Security

Under _Advanced -> Advanced Security -> Trusted MAC Address_, create a fake MAC address per port (ie. 02:00:00:00:00:xx where `xx` is the port number). This will have the effect of sending a security trap to PacketFence when a new device plugs on the port.
  
Don't forget to save the configuration!

==== GS108Tv2 / GS110T / GS110TP

PacketFence supports certain lower-end Netgear switches in Link Up/Link Down traps. These "web-managed" switches have no command-line interface and only a subset of the port security and 802.1X functionality needed to interoperate with PacketFence in these more advanced modes. There is no way to send a trap upon port security violation, and there is only pure 802.1X, no MAC Address Bypass.

[float]
===== Switch Configuration

It can be difficult to find the advanced features in the web GUI. We recommend using the GUI "Maintenance" tab to Upload the configuration to a file, and then edit it there.

Hints on file upload/download:

From the File Type menu, choose Text Configuration.

If you're uploading to the TFTP root directory, leave Path blank.

At the top of the config file, you need:

  vlan database
  vlan 1,2,3,4,5
  vlan name 1 "Normal"
  vlan name 2 "Registration"
  vlan name 3 "Isolation"
  vlan name 4 "MAC Detection"
  vlan name 5 "Guest"
  exit

In the same section as "users passwd", you need to specify your PacketFence server's management address:

  snmptrap useStrongerSecret ipaddr 192.168.1.5

In the same section as the "voip oui" lines, you need to allow your SNMP server:

  snmp-server community "public"
  snmp-server community rw useStrongerSecret
  snmp-server community ipaddr 192.168.1.5 public
  snmp-server community ipmask 255.255.255.0 public
  snmp-server community ipaddr 192.168.1.5 useStrongerSecret
  snmp-server community ipmask 255.255.255.0 useStrongerSecret
  no voip vlan

You should use port 1 as the uplink. If you connect port 1 of a GS108Tv2 switch into a Power over Ethernet switch, then the GS108Tv2 does not need AC power. If you bought GS110T(P) switches, presumably it's for the SFP uplink option. You'll want to configure both port 1 and the SFP ports 9-10 as trunks:

  interface 0/1
  no snmp trap link-status
  ip dhcp filtering trust
  vlan pvid 1
  vlan ingressfilter
  vlan participation include 1,2,3,4,5
  vlan tagging 2,3,4,5
  no auto-voip
  exit

Each user-facing, PacketFence-managed port should be configured like:

  interface 0/2
  vlan pvid 4
  vlan ingressfilter
  vlan participation include 4
  no auto-voip
  exit

==== M Series

PacketFence supports the Netgear M series in wired MAC authentication without VoIP.

===== On your interfaces

=== Nortel

PacketFence supports Nortel switches with VoIP using one trap type:

* Mac Security

Don't forget to update the startup config!

NOTE: if you are using a 5500 series with a firmware version of 6 or above, you must use a different module called Nortel::BayStack5500_6x in your `/usr/local/pf/conf/switches.conf`. Indeed, Nortel introduced an incompatible change of behavior in this firmware.

==== BayStack 470, ERS2500 Series, ERS4500 Series, 4550, 5500 Series and ES325

===== Global config settings

  snmp-server authentication-trap disable
  snmp-server host 192.168.1.5 "public"
  snmp trap link-status port 1-24 disable
  no mac-security mac-address-table
  interface FastEthernet ALL
  mac-security port ALL disable
  mac-security port 1-24 enable
  default mac-security auto-learning port ALL max-addrs
  exit
  mac-security enable
  mac-security snmp-lock disable
  mac-security intrusion-detect disable
  mac-security filtering enable
  mac-security snmp-trap enable
  mac-security auto-learning aging-time 60
  mac-security learning-ports NONE
  mac-security learning disable

[float]
===== VoIP support

You need to ensure that all your ports are tagged with the voice VLAN. The switch should do the rest for you.

  vlan create 6 name "Telephone" type port learning ivl
  vlan members 6 1-20,23-24

==== BPS2000

You can only configure this switch through menus.
