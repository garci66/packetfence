//=== LG-Ericsson

PacketFence supports iPECS series switches _without VoIP_ using two different trap types:

* linkUp / linkDown
* Port Security (with static MACs)

On some recent models, we can also use more secure and robust features, like:

* MAC Authentication
* 802.1X

==== ES-4500G Series

===== LinkUp / LinkDown

Firmware 1.2.3.2 is required for linkUp / linkDown

Prior to config, make sure to create all necessaries VLANs and config the appropriate uplink port.

Global config settings

  snmp-server community public ro
  snmp-server community private rw
  !
  snmp-server enable traps authentication
  snmp-server host 192.168.1.5 public version 2c udp-port 162
  snmp-server notify-filter traphost.192.168.1.5.public remote 192.168.1.5

Firmware is kinda buggy so you'll need to enable linkUp / linkDown using the Web Interface under *Administration -> SNMP*.

Some reports shows that the switch doesn't always send linkDown traps.

On each interface (except uplink)

  switchport allowed vlan add 4 untagged
  switchport native vlan 4
  switchport allowed vlan remove 1
  switchport mode access

===== Port-Security

Firmware 1.2.3.2 is required for port-security.

Prior to config, make sure to create all necessaries VLANs and config the appropriate uplink port.

Global config settings

  snmp-server community public ro
  snmp-server community private rw
  !
  snmp-server enable traps authentication
  snmp-server host 192.168.1.5 public version 2c udp-port 162
  snmp-server notify-filter traphost.192.168.1.5.public remote 192.168.1.5

On each interface (except uplink)

  port security max-mac-count 1
  port security
  port security action trap
  switchport allowed vlan add 2 untagged
  switchport native vlan 2
  switchport allowed vlan remove 1
  switchport mode access

The above _port security_ command may not work using the CLI. In this case, use the Web Interface under the _Security -> Port Security_ menu and enable each ports using the checkboxes.

It is also recommended, when using port-security, to disable link-change (UP / DOWN) traps.

Don't forget to update the startup config!
