//=== Huawei

==== AC6605 Controller

PacketFence supports this controller with the following technologies:

* Wireless 802.1X
* Wireless MAC Authentication

===== Controller configuration

Setup NTP server:

	<AC>system-view
	[AC] ntp-service unicast-server 208.69.56.110

Setup the radius server (@IP of PacketFence) authentication + accounting:

[NOTE]
===============================
In this configuration I will use the ip address of the VIP of PacketFence: 192.168.1.2; Registration VLAN : 145, Isolation VLAN : 146
===============================

	<AC>system-view
	[AC] radius-server template radius_packetfence
	[AC-radius-radius_packetfence] radius-server authentication 192.168.1.2 1812 weight 80
	[AC-radius-radius_packetfence] radius-server accounting 192.168.1.2 1813 weight 80

	[AC-aaa-domain-your.domain.com] radius-server radius_packetfence
	[AC-aaa-domain-your.domain.com] quit
	[AC-aaa] quit

===== Create an Secure dot1x SSID

Activate the dotx globally:

	<AC>system-view
	[AC] dot1x enable

Create your secure dot1x ssid:

Configure WLAN-ESS 0 interfaces:
	
	[AC] interface Wlan-Ess 0
	[AC-Wlan-Ess0] port hybrid untagged vlan 145 to 146
	[AC-Wlan-Ess0] dot1x enable
	[AC-Wlan-Ess0] dot1x authentication-method eap
	[AC-Wlan-Ess0] permit-domain name your.domain.com
	[AC-Wlan-Ess0] force-domain name your.domain.com
	[AC-Wlan-Ess0] default-domain your.domain.com
	[AC-Wlan-Ess0] quit

===== Configure AP parameters:
	
Configure radios for APs:

	[AC] wlan
	[AC-wlan-view] wmm-profile name huawei-ap
	[AC-wlan-wmm-prof-huawei-ap] quit
	[AC-wlan-view] radio-profile name huawei-ap
	[AC-wlan-radio-prof-huawei-ap] radio-type 80211gn
	[AC-wlan-radio-prof-huawei-ap] wmm-profile name huawei-ap
	[AC-wlan-radio-prof-huawei-ap] quit
	[AC-wlan-view] ap 1 radio 0
	[AC-wlan-radio-1/0] radio-profile name huawei-ap
	Warning: Modify the Radio type may cause some parameters of Radio resume defaul
	t value, are you sure to continue?[Y/N]: y
	[AC-wlan-radio-1/0] quit
	
Configure a security profile named huawei-ap. Set the security policy to WPA authentication, authentication method to 802.1X+PEAP, and encryption mode to CCMP:

	[AC-wlan-view] security-profile name huawei-ap-wpa2
	[AC-wlan-sec-prof-huawei-ap-wpa2] security-policy wpa2
	[AC-wlan-sec-prof-huawei-ap-wpa2] wpa-wpa2 authentication-method dot1x encryption-method ccmp
	[AC-wlan-sec-prof-huawei-ap-wpa2] quit

Configure a traffic profile:

	[AC-wlan-view] traffic-profile name huawei-ap
	[AC-wlan-wmm-traffic-huawei-ap] quit

Configure service sets for APs, and set the data forwarding mode to direct forwarding:

The direct forwarding mode is used by default.
	
	[AC-wlan-view] service-set name PacketFence-dot1x
	[AC-wlan-service-set-PacketFence-dot1x] ssid PacketFence-Secure
	[AC-wlan-service-set-PacketFence-dot1x] wlan-ess 0
	[AC-wlan-service-set-PacketFence-dot1x] service-vlan 1
	[AC-wlan-service-set-PacketFence-dot1x] security-profile name huawei-ap-wpa2
	[AC-wlan-service-set-PacketFence-dot1x] traffic-profile name huawei-ap
	[AC-wlan-service-set-PacketFence-dot1x] forward-mode tunnel
	[AC-wlan-service-set-PacketFence-dot1x] quit

Configure VAPs and deliver configurations to the APs:

	[AC-wlan-view] ap 1 radio 0
	[AC-wlan-radio-1/0] service-set name PacketFence-dot1x
	[AC-wlan-radio-1/0] quit
	[AC-wlan-view] commit ap 1

===== Create your Open ssid

Activate the mac-auth globally:

	<AC>system-view
	[AC] mac-authen
	[AC] mac-authen username macaddress format with-hyphen
	[AC] mac-authen domain your.domain.com

Create your Open ssid:

Configure WLAN-ESS 1 interfaces:

	[AC] interface Wlan-Ess 1
	[AC-Wlan-Ess1] port hybrid untagged vlan 145 to 146
	[AC-Wlan-Ess1] mac-authen
	[AC-Wlan-Ess1] mac-authen username macaddress format without-hyphen
	[AC-Wlan-Ess1] permit-domain name your.domain.com
	[AC-Wlan-Ess1] force-domain name your.domain.com
	[AC-Wlan-Ess1] default-domain your.domain.com
	[AC-Wlan-Ess1] quit

Configure AP parameters:

Configure a security profile named huawei-ap-wep. Set the security policy to WEP authentication.
	
	[AC]wlan
	[AC-wlan-view] security-profile name huawei-ap-wep
	[AC-wlan-sec-prof-huawei-ap-wep] security-policy wep
	[AC-wlan-sec-prof-huawei-ap-wep] quit

Configure service sets for APs, and set the data forwarding mode to direct forwarding:

The direct forwarding mode is used by default.
	
	[AC-wlan-view] service-set name PacketFence-WEP
	[AC-wlan-service-set-PacketFence-WEP] ssid PacketFence-Open
	[AC-wlan-service-set-PacketFence-WEP] wlan-ess 1
	[AC-wlan-service-set-PacketFence-WEP] service-vlan 1
	[AC-wlan-service-set-PacketFence-WEP] security-profile name huawei-ap-wep
	[AC-wlan-service-set-PacketFence-WEP] traffic-profile name huawei-ap (already created before)
	[AC-wlan-service-set-PacketFence-WEP] forward-mode tunnel
	[AC-wlan-service-set-PacketFence-WEP] quit

Configure VAPs and deliver configurations to the APs:

	[AC-wlan-view] ap 1 radio 0
	[AC-wlan-radio-1/0] service-set name PacketFence-WEP
	[AC-wlan-radio-1/0] quit
