//=== Alcatel

==== OS6250, OS6450 

PacketFence supports this switch using 802.1X, Mac authentication and also supports VoIP.

===== Global configuration

First define any VLAN that you want to use on the switch.

    vlan 2
    vlan 5
    vlan 20
    vlan 100

Next, configure the RADIUS server to be PacketFence

    aaa radius-server "packetfence" host 192.168.1.5 key useStrongerSecret
    aaa authentication mac packetfence
    aaa authentication 802.1X packetfence

You now need to configure a user profile (equivalent of a role) that will determine which VLAN is assigned to the device. In this case the profile names are 'unreg', 'employee' and 'guest'.

    aaa user-network-profile name unreg vlan 2
    aaa user-network-profile name guest vlan 5
    aaa user-network-profile name employee vlan 20

Next, configure the switch in PacketFence. In the case of this example, the uplink is port 1/1.
 
    [192.168.1.10]
    mode=production
    description=alcatel
    type=Alcatel
    radiusSecret=useStrongerSecret
    uplink_dynamic=0
    uplink=1001
    RoleMap=Y
    VlanMap=N
    registrationRole=unreg
    isolationRole=unreg
    defaultRole=employee
    guestRole=guest

===== 802.1X

First, make sure you followed the steps above in 'Global configuration'

You will need to configure the ports you want to do authentication on.

    vlan port mobile 1/2
    vlan port 1/2 802.1X enable
    802.1X 1/2 supplicant policy authentication pass group-mobility block fail block
    802.1X 1/2 non-supplicant policy authentication pass group-mobility block fail block

===== MAC Authentication

First, make sure you followed the steps above in 'Global configuration' and '802.1X'

Next configure the interface to bypass 802.1X authentication

    802.1X 1/2 supplicant bypass enable

===== VoIP

PacketFence supports VoIP on Alcatel by having multiple devices using multiple untagged VLANs on the same port.

First configure the user profile for voice. In this example it is only isolating it on another VLAN but any user profile attributes can be added to the profile.

    aaa user-network-profile name voice vlan 3

Next, make sure you enable VoIP in the switch configuration in PacketFence and configure the voiceRole.

    [192.168.1.10]
    VoIPEnabled=Y
    voiceRole=voice


==== OS6860

PacketFence supports this switch using 802.1X, Mac authentication and also supports VoIP.

NOTE: This documentation is made for Alcatel OS 8.1+. Lower versions do not support this configuration.

===== Global configuration

First define any VLAN that you want to use on the switch.

    vlan 2 admin-state enable
    vlan 5 admin-state enable
    vlan 20 admin-state enable
    vlan 100 admin-state enable

Next, configure the RADIUS server to be PacketFence

    aaa radius-server "packetfence" host 192.168.1.5 key useStrongerSecret
    aaa device-authentication mac packetfence
    aaa device-authentication 802.1X packetfence

You now need to configure an edge profile (equivalent of a role) that will determine which VLAN is assigned to the device. In this case the profile names are 'unreg', 'employee' and 'guest'.

    unp edge-profile unreg
    unp edge-profile unreg redirect enable
    unp edge-profile unreg authentication-flag enable
    unp vlan-mapping edge-profile unreg vlan 2

    unp edge-profile guest
    unp edge-profile guest redirect enable
    unp edge-profile guest authentication-flag enable
    unp vlan-mapping edge-profile guest vlan 5

    unp edge-profile employee
    unp edge-profile employee redirect enable
    unp edge-profile employee authentication-flag enable
    unp vlan-mapping edge-profile employee vlan 20

CAUTION: Make sure you enable the redirect on *all* your roles as the access reevaluation will not work without it.

Next, configure the switch in PacketFence. In the case of this example, the uplink is port 1/1/1.
 
    [192.168.1.10]
    mode=production
    description=alcatel
    type=Alcatel
    radiusSecret=useStrongerSecret
    uplink_dynamic=0
    uplink=1001
    RoleMap=Y
    VlanMap=N
    registrationRole=unreg
    isolationRole=unreg
    defaultRole=employee
    guestRole=guest

===== MAC Authentication

First, make sure you followed the steps above in 'Global configuration'

You will need to create an edge template and apply it on the ports you want to do authentication on.

    unp edge-template pf_mab
    unp edge-template pf_mab mac-authentication enable
    unp edge-template pf_mab classification enable
    unp port 1/1/2 port-type edge
    unp port 1/1/2 edge-template pf_mab

===== 802.1X

First, make sure you followed the steps above in 'Global configuration'

You will need to create an edge template and apply it on the ports you want to do authentication on.

    unp edge-template pf_dot1x
    unp edge-template pf_dot1x 802.1X-authentication enable
    unp edge-template pf_dot1x mac-authentication enable
    unp edge-template pf_dot1x 802.1X-authentication failure-policy mac-authentication
    unp port 1/1/2 port-type edge
    unp port 1/1/2 edge-template pf_dot1x

===== VoIP

PacketFence supports VoIP on Alcatel by having multiple devices using multiple untagged VLANs on the same port.

First configure the edge profile for voice. In this example it is only isolating it on another VLAN but any edge profile attributes can be added to the profile.

    unp edge-profile voice
    unp edge-profile voice redirect enable
    unp edge-profile voice authentication-flag enable
    unp vlan-mapping edge-profile voice vlan 100

Next, make sure you enable VoIP in the switch configuration in PacketFence and configure the voiceRole.

    [192.168.1.10]
    VoIPEnabled=Y
    voiceRole=voice
