//=== 3COM

==== SuperStack 3 Switch 4200 and 4500

PacketFence supports these 3Com switches _without VoIP_ using one trap type:

* linkUp===linkDown
* Port Security (with static MACs)

Don't forget to update the startup config!

===== linkUp === linkDown only


Global config settings:

  snmp-agent
  snmp-agent target-host trap address udp-domain 192.168.1.5 params securityname public
  snmp-agent trap enable standard linkup linkdown

On each interface:

  port access vlan 4

===== In Port Security

Global config settings:

  snmp-agent
  snmp-agent target-host trap address udp-domain 192.168.1.5 params securityname public
  snmp-agent trap enable
  port-security enable
  port-security trap addresslearned
  port-security trap intrusion

On each interface:

  port access vlan 4
  port-security max-mac-count 1
  port-security port-mode secure
  port-security intrusion-mode blockmac
  undo enable snmp trap updown

===== In MAC Auth 

 Voice vlan : 6
 Normal vlan : 1
 Registration vlan : 2
 Isolation vlan : 3

On each interface with VoIP:

  port hybrid vlan 1 2 3 untagged

==== E4800G

PacketFence supports these 3Com switches with the following techniques:

* 802.1X with MAC Authentication fallback
* linkUp/linkDown (not recommended)

Voice over IP support was not explicitly tested during implementation however 
it does not mean that it won't work. 

Don't forget to update the startup config!

===== linkUp / linkDown only

Global config settings:

  snmp-agent
  snmp-agent target-host trap address udp-domain 192.168.1.5 params securityname public
  snmp-agent trap enable standard linkup linkdown

On each interface:

  port access vlan 4

===== 802.1X with MAC Authentication fallback

Global config settings:

  system-view 
     radius scheme PacketFence 
       primary authentication 192.168.1.5 1812 
       primary accounting 192.168.1.5 1812 
       key authentication useStrongerSecret 
       user-name-format without-domain 
       quit 
     domain packetfence.local 
       authentication default radius-scheme PacketFence 
       authorization default radius-scheme PacketFence 
       quit 
     domain default enable packetfence.local 
     dot1x authentication-method eap 
     port-security enable 
  quit 

If your management authentication on your switch is default, applying the 
configuration above will have your authentication switch to a RADIUS based one
with PacketFence as the authentication server. *It is almost certain that you 
do not want that!*

Below, we will just create a local password for `vty` accesses (telnet) and 
nothing on the console. *In order to avoid locking yourself out, make sure 
to verify your configuration!*

  system-view 
     user-interface aux 0 
       authentication-mode none 
    user-interface vty 0 4 
      user privilege level 3 
      set authentication password simple useStrongerPassword 
    quit 
  quit 

On each interface:

  system-view 
    interface gigabitEthernet 1/0/xx 
      port-security port-mode mac-else-userlogin-secure-ext 
      # userlogin-secure-or-mac-ext could be used below instead 
      # see the Switch_4200G's documentation for a discussion about it 
      undo enable snmp trap updown 
      quit 
  quit 

where `xx` stands for the interface index.

==== NJ220 

This switch does not support port-security. 

To configure: use web interface to send the linkUp/linkDown traps to the PacketFence server.
