//=== Cisco Small Business (SMB)

The Cisco Small Business switches support MAC based authentication (MAB) as well as 802.1X and VoIP. Both technologies can be combined and will work correctly together on the same switchport.

Nothing is required to activate VoIP on the switch, you must simply configure the voice VLAN you want PacketFence to assign in the PacketFence switch configuration as well as enabling VoIP there. Note that your phones must *not* tag their packets on the network and should send their traffic untagged when connected into a PacketFence enabled port. This means you should not have the voice VLAN capabilities enabled on the switch itself as they might conflict with the authorization attributes returned by PacketFence.

==== Global configuration

CAUTION: Before executing these steps, make sure you have a local account configured to login on the switch or are pointing to a RADIUS server for management. Otherwise, you will not be able to login into the switch anymore.

You must first define your RADIUS server and point it to PacketFence:

  dot1x system-auth-control 
  radius-server key useStrongerSecret
  radius-server host 192.168.1.5

  aaa accounting dot1x start-stop group radius

  snmp-server community public ro view Default 
  snmp-server community private rw view Default 

SNMP configuration for the Cisco SG300:

  snmp-server community public ro view DefaultSuper
  snmp-server community private rw view DefaultSuper

==== MAC Authentication

In order to configure MAC authentication, you must enable it on each interface

  interface x/y/z
   dot1x host-mode multi-sessions 
   dot1x reauthentication 
   dot1x timeout quiet-period 10 
   dot1x timeout server-timeout 5 
   dot1x timeout supp-timeout 3 
   dot1x authentication mac 
   dot1x radius-attributes vlan 
   dot1x port-control auto 
   spanning-tree portfast 
   switchport mode general 
   switchport general pvid 2 

==== 802.1X with MAB

In order to configure 802.1X with a fall-back to MAC authentication, you must enable it on each interface

  interface x/y/z
   dot1x host-mode multi-sessions 
   dot1x reauthentication 
   dot1x timeout quiet-period 10 
   dot1x timeout server-timeout 5 
   dot1x timeout supp-timeout 3 
   dot1x authentication dot1x mac 
   dot1x radius-attributes vlan 
   dot1x port-control auto 
   spanning-tree portfast 
   switchport mode general 
   switchport general pvid 2 

Once you have configured your switchports, you must configure the switch in PacketFence with the following information:

* *Definition -> Type*: `Cisco SG500`
* *Definition -> Mode*: `production`
* *Definition -> Deauthentication Method*: `SNMP`
* *Definition -> VoIP* enabled if you need VoIP on this switch.
* *Roles -> voice VLAN* set to the VLAN you want to assign to the VoIP devices connecting to this switch.
* *RADIUS -> Secret Passphrase*: `useStrongerSecret`
* *SNMP -> Version*: `v2c`
* *SNMP -> Community Read*: `public`
* *SNMP -> Community Write*: `private`

==== 802.1X commands

  show dot1x
  show dot1x users
