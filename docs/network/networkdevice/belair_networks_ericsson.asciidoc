//=== Belair Networks (now Ericsson)

==== BE20

The Belair Networks BE20s are fairly easy to configure.

===== Add VLANs

On the BE20 Web Interface, click on *Eth-1-1*.  By default, there will be nothing in there.  You need to first create an untagged VLAN (VLAN 0). In order to do that, you need to set
the PVID, Reverse PVID, and the VLAN field to 0.  Then click add.

Repeat that step for each of your VLANs by entering the proper VLAN ID in the VLAN field.
   
===== AAA Servers

Once you have the VLANs setup, you need to add PacketFence into the AAA Server list.  Go to _System -> Radius Servers_.  Click on *Add server*, and fill out the proper information.

* Ensure the Enabled checkbox is selected
* IP Address: Insert the IP Address of the PacketFence Management Interface
* Shared Secret: Insert the shared secret for RADIUS communication

When done, click on the *Apply* button.

===== Secure SSID

Since the BE20 doesn't support Open SSID with MAC Authentication, we will only describe how to configure a WPA2-Enterprise SSID.  First, we will configure the 5GHz antenna.

Click on _Wifi-1-1 -> Access SSID Config_.  From the *Configuration for SSID* dropdown, select the 1 entry.  Modify the fields like the following:

* SSID: Put your SSID Name you would like
* Type: Broadcast
* Use Privacy Mode: WPA2(AES) with EAP/DOT1x
* RADIUS NAS Identifier: You can put a string to identify your AP
* Radius Accounting Enabled: Checkbox Selected
* Radius Station ID Delimiter: dash
* Radius StationId Append Ssid: Checkbox Selected
* RADIUS Server 1: Select the AAA Server you created earlier

When done click *Apply*.  Repeat the same configuration for the 2.4GHz Antenna (Wifi-1-2).

That should conclude the configuration.  You can now save the configs to the flash by hitting the *Config Save* button on top of the Interface.
