=== Shutting down a PacketFence Active/Active cluster of three nodes

As PacketFence cluster works in an active/active way, with statefull redundance, the order to stop the servers is not very important.

NOTE: The important thing is to start the servers in the opposite order that you will stop them .

Example:

* Stop order: pf1 -> pf2 -> pf3
* Start order: pf3 -> pf2 -> pf1

Shutdown the servers:

* Logon to the first server with a SSH terminal
* Type the following command: *shutdown -h now*
* Logon to the next server, with a SSH terminal.
* Type the following command: *ping IP_ADDRESS_OF_THE_FIRST_SERVER*
* Once the server do not responce back, type the following command: *shutdown -h now*
* Proceed the same way with the last server.

=== Bringing up a PacketFence Active/Active cluster of three nodes

We want to bring up the cluster, in the same state it was before the shutdown.

Therefore, we will do the _Shutting down_ procedure, but in reverse.

==== Bring up the "Last" server stopped

Start the server (pf3 in our example) and wait a couple of minutes and ensure you are able to connect to it using SSH before continuing.

==== Bring up the next server

Start the next server (pf2 in our example), logon to the SSH terminal.

Once prompted, check the `packetFence-mariadb` sync with the Master, type the command:
----
mysql -u root -p
MariaDB> show status like 'wsrep%';
----
----
MariaDB [(none)]> show status like "wsrep%";
+------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| Variable_name                | Value                                                 |
+------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
...
| wsrep_cluster_size           | 2                                                     |
...
| wsrep_connected              | ON                                                    |
...
| wsrep_evs_state              | OPERATIONAL                                           |
...
| wsrep_local_state_comment    | Synced                                                |
...
+------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
----

==== Bring up the next server

Once the 2 other servers have synced together, you can start the next server that remains. Logon on terminal and go with a *show status like 'wsrep%';* once again.

* The values must have changed to:
----
MariaDB [(none)]> show status like "wsrep%";
+------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| Variable_name                | Value                                                 |
+------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
...
| wsrep_cluster_size           | 3                                                     |
...
| wsrep_evs_state              | OPERATIONAL                                           |
...
| wsrep_local_state_comment    | Synced                                                |
...
+------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+

NOTE: The _wsrep_incoming_addresses_ will give you the IP addresses of the nodes synced.

NOTE: The _wsrep_cluster_status_ will always be *Primary*, even on the slaves.

=== Backup procedure

==== Automatic Backup files

The PacketFence servers have a daily backup done, each night (0:30AM).

If you need to externalize those backups, they are in:

----
/root/backup
----
Files description:

* `packetfence-db-dump-innobackup-DATE_00h30.xbstream.gz` are the SQL dump of your MariaDB database.
* `packetfence-files-dump-DATE_00h30.tgz` are the dump of the PacketFence files.

==== Manual backups

In case you need to make a "manual" backup, you can type the following command:

----
/usr/local/pf/addons/backup-and-maintenance.sh
----

As the daily automatic backups, you will find the files in:

----
/root/backup/
----

Two files will be available, tagged with the Date and Time of your backup.
