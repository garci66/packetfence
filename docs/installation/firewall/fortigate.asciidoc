//=== FortiGate

==== Configuration of the RSSO Agent

Go to your FortiGate administration webpage in *User & Device -> User -> User Groups -> Create New*.

[options="compact"]
* *Name*: RSSO_group
* *Type*: RADIUS Single Sign-On (RSSO)
* *RADIUS Attribute Value*: RSSO_Student (use the rolename of PacketFence, it's case sensitive)

You can also see that in the webpage at *User & Device -> Monitor -> Firewall*

==== Configure the endpoint attribute

The default endpoint attribute is the Calling-Station-Id so the MAC address shows up under User Name, we can change that in CLI:

----
config user radius
edit RSSO_agent
set rsso-endpoint-attribute User-Name
end
----

==== Activate the Accounting Listening

Go to *System -> Network -> Interfaces*.

Select the interface that will communicate with PacketFence and check 'Listen for RADIUS Accounting Messages' then confirm.

[options="compact"]
* *Hostname or IP Address*: IP of your firewall
* *Secret or Key*: secret (radius shared secret)
* *Port*: 1813
* *Roles*: add the roles that you want to do SSO

----
di debug enable
di debug application radiusd -1
