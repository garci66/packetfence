==== Preliminary steps

First, attach ISE-PIC to Active Directory and set it up as an Identity Provider as described here:
https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/ise/2-6/pic_admin_guide/PIC_admin26/PIC_admin26_chapter_010.html


==== Syslog template

Add a new Template and call it `PacketFence`.  Make it match the following:

image::doc-ise-pic-syslog-template.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Configure the syslog template in ISE-PIC"]

[options="compact"]
* The new mapping should be set to: `assigned to session`
* The regular expression for the IP address is: `Address <([^\s]+)>|address ([^\s]+)`
* The regular expression for the username is: `User <([^\s]+)>`


==== Syslog provider

To add PacketFence as an identity provider, hover over "Providers" and click "Syslog Providers.", then click "Add".

Then add each of your PacketFence servers as Syslog providers using the syslog template you created above. 
In the case of a cluster, add each member management IP and the management virtual IP.

NOTE: In your DNS servers, make sure the FQDN and reverse lookup entries match your PacketFence server FQDN.

Make sure your syslog header configuration matches this:

==== PacketFence configuration

Add a Cisco ISE-PIC firewall SSO entry in "Configuration->Integration->Firewall SSO"

image::doc-ise-pic-pf-configuration.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Configure ISE-PIC in PacketFence"]

[options="compact"]
* *Hostname or IP Address*: IP of your Cisco ISE-PIC instance
* *Port*: 40514
* *Roles*: add the roles that you want to do SSO with

You should then see User Sessions populating under “Live Logs” in ISE-PIC. The source should say "syslog"
