//=== Juniper SRX

==== Configuration of the Juniper SRX in PacketFence

Go to *Configuration -> Integration -> Firewall SSO -> Add Firewall -> JuniperSRX*.

[options="compact"]
* *Hostname or IP Address*: IP of your JuniperSRX
* *Firewall type*: JuniperSRX (JuniperSRX = HTTPS requests)
* *Password*: secret
* *Port*: 8443
* *Roles*: add the roles that you want to do SSO

==== Step 1: webapi configuration

You need to setup webapi management as follows

 set system services webapi user PF
 set system services webapi user password YOURPASSWORD
 set system services webapi client PF_MANAGEMENT_IP_ADDRESS

 set system services webapi https port PORT_YOU_WANT_TO_USE i.e. 8443
 set system services webapi https default-certificate

Next setup user entry settings

 set services user-identification authentication-source aruba-clearpass authentication-entry-timeout 120
 set services user-identification authentication-source aruba-clearpass no-user-query
 set services user-identification device-information authentication-source network-access-controller

Then you need to allow traffic from the PacketFence management interface to port you set up on webapi settings (i.e. 8443) on SRX device.


==== Step 2: Verification

For debuging the webapi set (disable it when you won't need it anymore):

 set system services webapi debug-log api-log
 set system services webapi debug-level notice

To check registered device entries on SRX use

 show services user-identification authentication-table authentication-source all ( extensive for more detailed informations)

or

 run show services user-identification device-information table all extensive

to see more details about OS, device type etc.
