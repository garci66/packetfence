//== Troubleshooting PacketFence

=== RADIUS Audit Log

PacketFence provides a RADIUS auditing module which allows you to be aware of all the incoming RADIUS requests/responses handled by PacketFence. The RADIUS auditing module is available from _Auditing -> RADIUS Audit Log_. Advanced search criterias can be specified to create complex search expressions - which can be saved for later use. Clicking on a RADIUS log entry will display the endpoint information, where the RADIUS request originated from and the RADIUS payload exchanged between the NAS and PacketFence.

=== Log files

Here are the most important PacketFence log files:

[options="compact"]
* `/usr/local/pf/logs/packetfence.log` — PacketFence Core Log
* `/usr/local/pf/logs/httpd.portal.access` — Apache – Captive Portal Access Log
* `/usr/local/pf/logs/httpd.portal.error` — Apache – Captive Portal Error Log
* `/usr/local/pf/logs/httpd.admin.access` — Apache – Web Admin/Services Access Log
* `/usr/local/pf/logs/httpd.admin.error` — Apache – Web Admin/Services Error Log
* `/usr/local/pf/logs/httpd.webservices.access` — Apache – Webservices Access Log
* `/usr/local/pf/logs/httpd.webservices.error` — Apache – Webservices Error Log
* `/usr/local/pf/logs/httpd.aaa.access` — Apache – AAA Access Log
* `/usr/local/pf/logs/httpd.aaa.error` — Apache – AAA Error Log

There are other log files in [filename]`/usr/local/pf/logs/` that could be relevant depending on what issue you are experiencing. Make sure you take a look at them.

The main logging configuration file is [filename]`/usr/local/pf/conf/log.conf`. It contains the configuration for the `packetfence.log` file (`Log::Log4Perl`) and you normally don't need to modify it. The logging configuration files for every service are located under [filename]`/usr/local/pf/conf/log.conf.d/`.

=== RADIUS Debugging

First, check the FreeRADIUS logs. The file is located at [filename]`/usr/local/pf/logs/radius.log`.

If this didn't help, run FreeRADIUS in debug mode. To do so, start it using the following commands.

For the authentication radius process:

[source,bash]
----
radiusd -X -d /usr/local/pf/raddb -n auth
----

For the accounting radius process:

[source,bash]
----
radiusd -X -d /usr/local/pf/raddb -n acct
----

Additionally there is a `raddebug` tool that can extract debug logs from a
running FreeRADIUS daemon. PacketFence's FreeRADIUS is pre-configured with such support.

In order to have an output from `raddebug`, you need to either:

a. Make sure user `pf` has a shell in `/etc/passwd`, add `/usr/sbin` to PATH (`export PATH=/usr/sbin:$PATH`) and execute `raddebug` as `pf`
b. Run `raddebug` as root (less secure!)

Now you can run `raddebug` easily:

[source,bash]
----
raddebug -t 300 -f /usr/local/pf/var/run/radiusd.sock
----

The above will output FreeRADIUS' authentication debug logs for 5 minutes.

Use the following to debug radius accounting:

[source,bash]
----
raddebug -t 300 -f /usr/local/pf/var/run/radiusd-acct.sock
----

See `man raddebug` for all the options.
