//== Adding VLAN Enforcement to Existing Installation

=== Introduction

In order to build a VLAN isolation setup you need :

* a supported switch (please consult the list of supported switch vendors and types in the _Network Devices Configuration Guide_ including information on uplinks
* a normal, registration and isolation VLAN (VLAN numbers and subnets)
* a switch port for the PacketFence (PacketFence) server which needs to be configured as a dot1q trunk (several VLANs on the port)

Throughout this configuration example we use the following assumptions for our network infrastructure:

* VLAN 20 is the management VLAN
* VLAN 102 is the registration VLAN (unregistered devices will be put in this VLAN)
* VLAN 103 is the isolation VLAN (isolated devices will be put in this VLAN)
* VLAN 104 is the normal VLAN (registered devices will be put in this VLAN)

Please refer to the following table for IP and Subnet information :

[options="header",cols="4*",grid="rows"]
|===
|VLAN ID  |VLAN Name     |Subnet           |Gateway
|20       |Management    |172.20.100.0/16  |172.20.0.1
|102      |Registration  |192.168.102.0/24 |192.168.102.1
|103      |Isolation     |192.168.103.0/24 |192.168.103.1
|104      |Normal        |10.0.104.0/24    |10.0.104.1
|===

[options="header",cols="5*",grid="rows"]

|VLAN ID  |VLAN Name     |PacketFence Address|DHCP                       |DNS
|20       |Management    |172.20.100.2       |infrastructure DHCP server |infrastructure DNS server
|102      |Registration  |192.168.102.1      |PF                         |PF
|103      |Isolation     |192.168.103.1      |PF                         |PF
|104      |Normal        |                   |infrastructure DHCP server |infrastructure DNS server

Note that PacketFence will provide these services on its registration and isolation VLANs:

* PacketFence provides its own DHCP services. It will take care of IP address distribution in VLANs 102 and 103. PacketFence will not provide DHCP services on VLAN 104 - this is the responsibility of your own infrastructure
* PacketFence provides its own DNS service. It will take care of naming resolution in VLANs 102 and 103. PacketFence will not provide DNS services on VLAN 104 - this is the responsibility of your own infrastructure

=== Adding the Registration, Isolation and Other Interface

First of all, make sure you add a new NIC to your PacketFence server and you set the switch port where that NIC is connected in `trunk`. If you prefer, you can also set your management interface as trunk and set the PVID to your management VLAN on the switch port where that management is connected.

We will create three interfaces VLAN for registration, isolation and normal using the management interface.

The required interface types for VLAN enforcement are:

[options="compact"]
* Management
* Registration
* Isolation
* Other

Note that you can only set *one* (1) management interface.

In our example, we will create three new VLANs on the wired interface on our new trunk interface (`ens224`)
To do so, click the 'Add VLAN' button besides the wired interface for each of the needed VLAN:

Here's a sample configuration for both of them:

Registration

 Virtual LAN ID: 102
 IP Address: 192.168.102.1
 Netmask: 255.255.255.0

Isolation

 Virtual LAN ID: 103
 IP Address: 192.168.103.1
 Netmask: 255.255.255.0
    
Normal

 Virtual LAN ID: 104
    
NOTE: Ignore the High-Availability options for now. If you are interested in a PacketFence cluster, please refer to the PacketFence Clustering Guide.

According to our example, we'll associate the correct type the each interfaces.

 ens160: Management
 ens224 VLAN 102: Registration
 ens224 VLAN 103: Isolation
 ens224 VLAN 104: Other

Make sure that those three interfaces are in an *enabled* state for the persistence to occur. We also need to set the Default Gateway which will generally be the gateway of the management network.

Finally, from _Status->Services_, restart the `haproxy-portal`, `pfdhcp`, `iptables`, `pfdhcplistener`, `pfdns` services.


=== Network Devices

Now let's modify our switch configuration to enable our new registration and isolation VLANs. From 'Configuration->Policies and Access Control->Switches', click on our Cisco 2960 switch we added earlier (172.21.2.3).

From the Roles tab, make sure you specify the following information:

 Role by VLAN ID: checked
 registration VLAN: 102
 isolation VLAN: 103
 default: 104
 guest: 104

Disable 'Role by Switch Role' and 'Role by Web Auth URL'.

Click on the 'Save' button once completed.

==== Configure the Cisco Catalyst 2960

In previous sections, we correctly configured our switch to do 802.1X. Now let's slightly modify that configuration so that we enable MAC authentication and 802.1X on a new switch port. This will demonstrate the configuration differences.

==== Configure Switchport for MAB

Once AAA is ready, we can configure some or all switchports to perform MAB (MAC Authentication Bypass) and 802.1X. In our example, we will only configure port no. 11 without VoIP support:
   
 switchport mode access
 authentication host-mode single-host
 authentication order mab dot1x
 authentication priority mab dot1x
 authentication port-control auto
 authentication periodic
 authentication timer restart 10800
 authentication timer reauthenticate 10800
 mab
 no snmp trap link-status
 dot1x pae authenticator
 dot1x timeout quiet-period 2
 dot1x timeout tx-period 3

If you want to test some ports with a VoIP phone (ex: Voice VLAN 200), add the following lines to your interface configuration:

 switchport voice vlan 200
 authentication host-mode multi-domain

==== Configure SNMP

Finally, for some operations (like VoIP), PacketFence still need to have SNMP access to the switch.  Make sure you configure the two SNMP communities like:

 snmp-server community ciscoRead ro
 snmp-server community ciscoWrite rw

NOTE: You can refer to the http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/switches/lan/catalyst2960/software/release/15.0_1_se/configuration/guide/sw8021x.html[Cisco Catalyst documentation] for more options.


==== Save the Configuration

When done, don't forget to save your configuration changes using the `write mem` command.

=== Adding Connection Profile for Registration


Next thing we do is to add a new connection profile - for devices coming from the registration network. We want to show users the captive portal with our Null authentication sources.

From 'Configuration->Policies and Access Control->Connection Profiles', click on 'Add Profile'. Provide the following information:

 * Profile Name: registration
 * Filters: If *any* VLAN 102
 * Sources: null-source

Then click on 'Save'.

==== Testing VLAN Based Enforcement

You can now test the registration process. In order to do so:

* connect an unregistered device into the switch
* make sure PacketFence receives the radius authentication request from the switch. Look into the PacketFence log file: `/usr/local/pf/logs/packetfence.log`
* make sure PacketFence handles RADIUS requests and sets the switch port to the registration VLAN (VLAN 102). Look again into PacketFence log file: `/usr/local/pf/logs/packetfence.log`

On the computer:

* open a web browser
* try to connect to a HTTP site (Not HTTPS, eg. http://www.packetfence.org)
* make sure that whatever site you want to connect to, you have only access to the registration page.

Register the computer using the Null authentication source.

Once a computer has been registered, make sure:

* PacketFence puts the switch port into the normal VLAN (VLAN 104)
* The computer has access to the network and the Internet.
